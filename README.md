# FinalProj_ENSF409
Our program for the Calgary Crisis Connect allows an administrator to log-in to the program and connect to the database, allowing the user to manage calls, manage volunteers, manage schedules, and generate a comprehensive report. Our intuitive user interface will allow the user to return to previous menus and quit the program when needed.\
<br>
**Managing Calls:** While in the manage calls subsection, the user can view calls; add new calls; 
modify call details; and update a call status. While viewing calls, the administrator may filter by 
either urgency level or status, or they may view all calls from all time. To filter by urgency, the user 
will be shown different urgency levels and may filter by a specific urgency (e.g, general support, 
depression, suicide risk, etc.). When filtering by status, the administrator may filter by pending, 
active, resolved, or escalated. While adding new calls, the administrator must enter the caller 
phone number, whether the caller is anonymous, the urgency level, and any notes associated with 
the call. While modifying call details, the administrator can enter new notes or update the call 
duration. When updating the call duration, the duration must be entered in the format of 
“hh:mm:ss”. In the update status section, the call ID is required and then the new status can be 
entered.\
<br>
**Managing volunteers:** In this section, the administrator may either view counselors or modify availability. If view counselors is selected, the user may then filter by specialty, availability, or view all volunteers. If modify availability is selected, the volunteer index must be entered as well as their updated availability.\
<br>
**Manage Schedules:** While in the manage schedules menu, the administrator can either assign calls based on urgency or assign the smallest available counselor workload.\
<br>
**Generate Report:** This selection allows the administrator to generate a comprehensive report of the daily calls.\
The program will pull from the database every three interactions.
